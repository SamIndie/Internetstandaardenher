        <div class="phomepag1">
          <p> As a child, I remember very vividly, being curious and explorative towards anything new. That was my main
            attitude. I was a dreamer, deep thinker - a kid who wanted to try out anything, supported and validated by
            my care givers and protectors. I was keen on doing things myself, but very eager to learn from others how to
            do those things, so that I could perform any task or activity on my own.As most of us grew up, we are unconsciously and unintentionally conditioned by the emotional projections of
            the people who raise and protect us. As kids we are prone to protection and therefor, in most cases,
            unintentionally held from living our true nature: playful, adventurous, explorative truth seekers. As was I,
            imposed by fear, doubt and anxiety towards the unknown and most of all fear of failure. I unconsciously
            thought myself that only those who have natural talents for creative expression, were able to make
            effortless art, paintings, designs, drawings and more. I thought there were creatives and math kids.</p>
          <p>The words and other forms of expression you see in any of my concepts are all intentional, flowing from my
            being in its most truest and deepest form. I believe that sharing my craft with the world is my Dharma -
            Sanskrit for life purpose. The craft is not about me, not about the validation or praise it attracts or that
            I feel it deserves, but merely the truest form of expression that I put into the world to serve its
            increasing consciousness. If I catch myself in patterns of making this about myself, rest assure that I will
            be checking myself in the other room. If there is anything on this platform that speaks to your heart, check in with your inner world and reach
            out with a full YES. If you are hesitant, have questions or need a bit more of an explanation, I will be at
            the other end making sure to get back at you</p>
